## Direct Use
For implementation download the repository and run`` face_data.py``. This will store the face information as ``face_00.npy``. To store the next face change the save command by renaming it as ``face_01``.

Repeat the same process for the number of faces you want to store. 
For corresponding face_data files, load corresponding face_data to the ``face_reco.py`` file.

For the corresponding face information add names to be displayed in the ``names`` dictionary in ``face_reco.py``

Finally, open terminal or command prompt and enter ``python face_reco.py``.
